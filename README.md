# Agent and Obstacles in an Environment

## Evader

In this repository, we create an agent ("space ship") which tries to evade obstacles ("barrier") specified by the user in an environment.

The number of obstacles can be specified; and the threshold which is the distance between the moving agent and the static obstacles.

Here, the obstacles are placed randomly in the environment. Furthermore, we have a bias direction of motion to the agent to prefer to go UP, but only when it does not encounter any obstacle.
Otherwise, it chooses a different random movement.

The result is provided in a 30 seconds video in this repo.
